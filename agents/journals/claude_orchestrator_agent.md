## [J-orchestrator-0001] 2026-08-01T16:03:25Z | task:none | Bootstrap: operating protocol, enforcement machinery, journal seeds
### Trigger
Sponsor approved the M0 plan (org + charter only) after selecting: phased
NIC→feed-handler project, simulation-first target, direct-commit git flow.
This is the program's first unit of work.
### Inputs
Approved plan (session plan file); judged org-design workflow results
(winner "Lean Five" 86/100 + grafts from "Twin-Ladder" and "Silicon-Team
Mirror"); Hardcaml ecosystem and project-scoping research briefs.
### Reasoning
Protocol and enforcement must exist before any other artifact so that every
subsequent commit — including this milestone's own — lands under the rules.
Key design choices: (1) append-only verified as a byte-prefix check rather
than diff-hunk parsing — simpler and immune to diff-format edge cases;
(2) Files-in-this-commit set-equality as the mechanical narrative↔diff
binding, per the design review's strongest graft; (3) foreign journals
committable only as entry-free seeds (R8), which permits this bootstrap
commit to carry all nine journal births without violating one-agent-per-commit;
(4) CI re-verifies the whole pushed range so a bypassed local script still
fails on GitHub; (5) merge commits are skipped by the range checker —
accepted because R9 serializes history and milestone merges must be
conflict-free. Rejected alternative: git pre-commit hooks via core.hooksPath —
weaker than making agent_commit.sh the only sanctioned path, since hooks are
trivially bypassed locally and CI re-checks regardless.
### Actions
Wrote agents/PROTOCOL.md (v1.0); scripts/policy.sh, agent_commit.sh,
check_journals.sh, test_protocol.sh; .github/workflows/journal-check.yml;
seeded all nine journals; agents/journals/INDEX.md; tasks/BOARD.md;
agents/handoffs/README.md (packet templates); .gitignore.
### Evidence
bash scripts/test_protocol.sh → "protocol self-test: 13 passed, 0 failed"
(scenarios S1–S12 incl. bootstrap-with-seeds, tamper, files-list mismatch,
path isolation, non-monotonic IDs, foreign-journal modification, raw-commit
detection, history rewrite).
### Outcome
Enforcement core complete and self-tested; G0 items 1, 3, 4 satisfied pending
this commit. Handoff: none — next unit is org chart + supporting docs.

## [J-orchestrator-0002] 2026-08-01T16:03:46Z | task:none | Org chart, README, ADR-0001, G0 checklist, agent launchers
### Trigger
Continuation of M0 bootstrap after J-orchestrator-0001 landed the enforcement
core.
### Inputs
agents/PROTOCOL.md; judged org design + synthesis notes (grafts 1–15);
project-scoping research (phase decomposition, references, licensing).
### Reasoning
Charters are the operative truth and launchers are deliberately thin: the
.claude/agents/ files carry only model tier, spawn guidance, and
non-negotiables, each pointing at its charter — keeping the human-reviewable
charter as the single source of instructions and the launcher immune to
drift. ORG_CHART encodes the two independence lines (DV never graded by
design; auditor graded only by the sponsor) and states honestly that solid
arrows terminate at the orchestrator because subagents cannot spawn
subagents. ADR-0001 records the full design provenance including rejected
alternatives, so a future session can reconstruct why this org looks the way
it does. Mermaid edge labels kept single-line to avoid GitHub render risk.
G0 checklist includes the one action only the sponsor can take (branch
protection on main) — the append-only guarantee is voidable without it.
### Actions
Wrote ORG_CHART.md, README.md, docs/adr/ADR-0001-org-design.md,
docs/gates/G0-checklist.md, and eight launchers under .claude/agents/
(architect_docs_lead, rtl_lead, dv_lead, auditor, rtl_module_dev, tb_writer,
data_wrangler, formal_dv; rtl_lead_md gets one at activation). Note:
--extra-trailer support for session attribution was added to
scripts/agent_commit.sh before J-orchestrator-0001 was committed, so it is
already part of that commit's staged set, not this one's — the R4 check
rejected this entry's first draft for claiming it, which is the mechanism
working as intended.
### Evidence
bash scripts/test_protocol.sh → "protocol self-test: 13 passed, 0 failed"
(re-run after the agent_commit.sh change).
### Outcome
G0 items 1–4 now materially complete; charters (item 2) in progress via
nine parallel charter writers, to land as the next unit with an adversarial
review to follow. Handoff: none.

## [J-orchestrator-0003] 2026-08-01T16:08:17Z | task:none | Commit the nine agent charters (parallel-drafted, pre-review)
### Trigger
Charter-writer fan-out completed: nine parallel agents, one per charter, each
working from agents/PROTOCOL.md, the handoff templates, and its per-agent
design brief (judged org design + review grafts).
### Inputs
agents/PROTOCOL.md; agents/handoffs/README.md; scratchpad briefs
(design responsibilities, evaluation criteria, grafts per agent); nine
writer reports with open questions.
### Reasoning
Charters were drafted in parallel for speed with consistency protected by a
fixed section structure, a shared vocabulary (roster names, packet prefixes,
gate names, E1-E6), and PROTOCOL as required reading. Committing the drafts
before the adversarial review — rather than after — keeps the review's
findings and fixes visible in history as their own attributable unit, which
is itself a demonstration of the journaling guarantee. Writers surfaced ten
open questions (notably: mutation-manifest mechanics for an auditor that can
only stage docs/reports/audit/; attack-plan canonical path
test/attack_plans/AP-<module>.md; traceability-matrix ownership split;
golden-model authorship vs data_wrangler execution). All are queued as input
to the adversarial review round rather than resolved ad hoc here.
### Actions
Committed agents/charters/{orchestrator,architect_docs_lead,rtl_lead,dv_lead,
auditor,rtl_module_dev,tb_writer,data_wrangler,formal_dv}.md as drafted by
the writer fan-out.
### Evidence
Writer fan-out: 9/9 agents completed, 0 failed (workflow wf_e4ece6e4-409).
Spot-check read of dv_lead.md confirmed structure, grafts, and honest
enforcement notes present.
### Outcome
G0 item 2 materially complete pending review disposition (G0 item 6).
Handoff: adversarial review round (three independent reviewers).
### Open-questions
Ten writer questions queued for the review round (see Reasoning).
