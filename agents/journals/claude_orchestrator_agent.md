## [J-orchestrator-0001] 2026-08-01T16:03:25Z | task:none | Bootstrap: operating protocol, enforcement machinery, journal seeds
### Trigger
Sponsor approved the M0 plan (org + charter only) after selecting: phased
NIC→feed-handler project, simulation-first target, direct-commit git flow.
This is the program's first unit of work.
### Inputs
Approved plan (session plan file); judged org-design workflow results
(winner "Lean Five" 86/100 + grafts from "Twin-Ladder" and "Silicon-Team
Mirror"); Hardcaml ecosystem and project-scoping research briefs.
### Reasoning
Protocol and enforcement must exist before any other artifact so that every
subsequent commit — including this milestone's own — lands under the rules.
Key design choices: (1) append-only verified as a byte-prefix check rather
than diff-hunk parsing — simpler and immune to diff-format edge cases;
(2) Files-in-this-commit set-equality as the mechanical narrative↔diff
binding, per the design review's strongest graft; (3) foreign journals
committable only as entry-free seeds (R8), which permits this bootstrap
commit to carry all nine journal births without violating one-agent-per-commit;
(4) CI re-verifies the whole pushed range so a bypassed local script still
fails on GitHub; (5) merge commits are skipped by the range checker —
accepted because R9 serializes history and milestone merges must be
conflict-free. Rejected alternative: git pre-commit hooks via core.hooksPath —
weaker than making agent_commit.sh the only sanctioned path, since hooks are
trivially bypassed locally and CI re-checks regardless.
### Actions
Wrote agents/PROTOCOL.md (v1.0); scripts/policy.sh, agent_commit.sh,
check_journals.sh, test_protocol.sh; .github/workflows/journal-check.yml;
seeded all nine journals; agents/journals/INDEX.md; tasks/BOARD.md;
agents/handoffs/README.md (packet templates); .gitignore.
### Evidence
bash scripts/test_protocol.sh → "protocol self-test: 13 passed, 0 failed"
(scenarios S1–S12 incl. bootstrap-with-seeds, tamper, files-list mismatch,
path isolation, non-monotonic IDs, foreign-journal modification, raw-commit
detection, history rewrite).
### Outcome
Enforcement core complete and self-tested; G0 items 1, 3, 4 satisfied pending
this commit. Handoff: none — next unit is org chart + supporting docs.
### Open-questions
